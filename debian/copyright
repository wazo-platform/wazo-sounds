License: CC-BY-SA-3.0
 THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS
 CREATIVE COMMONS PUBLIC LICENSE ("CCPL" OR "LICENSE"). THE WORK IS
 PROTECTED BY COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE
 WORK OTHER THAN AS AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS
 PROHIBITED.
 .
 BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND
 AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. TO THE EXTENT THIS
 LICENSE MAY BE CONSIDERED TO BE A CONTRACT, THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU
 THE RIGHTS CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH
 TERMS AND CONDITIONS.
 .
 1. Definitions.
 .
 a. "Collective Work" means a work, such as a periodical issue,
 anthology or encyclopedia, in which the Work in its entirety in
 unmodified form, along with one or more other contributions,
 constituting separate and independent works in themselves, are
 assembled into a collective whole. A work that constitutes a
 Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work (as defined
 below) for the purposes of this License.
 .
 b. "Creative Commons Compatible License" means a license that is
 listed at http://creativecommons.org/compatiblelicenses that has been
 approved by Creative Commons as being essentially equivalent to this
 License, including, at a minimum, because that license: (i) contains
 terms that have the same purpose, meaning and effect as the License
 Elements of this License; and, (ii) explicitly permits the relicensing
 of derivatives of works made available under that license under this
 License or either a Creative Commons unported license or a Creative
 Commons jurisdiction license with the same License Elements as this
 License.
 .
 c. "Derivative Work" means a work based upon the Work or upon the Work
 and other pre-existing works, such as a translation, musical
 arrangement, dramatization, fictionalization, motion picture version,
 sound recording, art reproduction, abridgment, condensation, or any
 other form in which the Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted,
 except that a work that constitutes a Collective Work will not be
 considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this License. For the
 avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical composition or sound
 recording, the synchronization of the Work in timed-relation with a
 moving image ("synching") will be considered a Derivative Work for the
 purpose of this License.
 .
 d. "License Elements" means the following high-level license
 attributes as selected by Licensor and indicated in the title of this
 License: Attribution, ShareAlike.
 .
 e. "Licensor" means the individual, individuals, entity or entities
 that offers the Work under the terms of this License.
 .
 f. "Original Author" means the individual, individuals, entity or
 entities who created the Work.
 .
 g. "Work" means the copyrighted voice prompt files recorded by June
 Wallack for Asterisk and distributed with this License.
 .
 h. "You" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this
 License who has not previously violated the terms of this License with
 respect to the Work, or who has received express permission from the
 Licensor to exercise rights under this License despite a previous
 violation.
 .
 2. Fair Use Rights.
 .
 Nothing in this license is intended to reduce, limit, or restrict any
 rights arising from fair use, first sale or other limitations on the
 exclusive rights of the copyright owner under copyright law or other
 applicable laws.
 .
 3. License Grant.
 .
 Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor hereby
 grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for
 the duration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise the
 rights in the Work as stated below:
 .
 a. to reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more
 Collective Works, and to reproduce the Work as incorporated in the
 Collective Works;
 .
 b. to create and reproduce Derivative Works provided that any such
 Derivative Work, including any translation in any medium, takes
 reasonable steps to clearly label, demarcate or otherwise identify
 that changes were made to the original Work. For example, a
 translation could be marked "The original work was translated from
 English to Spanish," or a modification could indicate "The original
 work has been modified.";
 .
 c. to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform
 publicly, and perform publicly by means of a digital audio
 transmission the Work including as incorporated in Collective Works;
 .
 d. to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform
 publicly, and perform publicly by means of a digital audio
 transmission Derivative Works.
 .
 e. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical
 composition:
 .
  i. Performance Royalties Under Blanket Licenses. Licensor waives the
  exclusive right to collect, whether individually or, in the event
  that Licensor is a member of a performance rights society
  (e.g. ASCAP, BMI, SESAC), via that society, royalties for the public
  performance or public digital performance e.g. webcast) of the Work.
 .
  ii.Mechanical Rights and Statutory Royalties. Licensor waives the
  exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a music
  rights agency or designated agent (e.g. Harry Fox Agency), royalties
  for any phonorecord You create from the Work ("cover version") and
  distribute, subject to the compulsory license created by 17 USC
  Section 115 of the US Copyright Act (or the equivalent in other
  jurisdictions).
 .
 f. Webcasting Rights and Statutory Royalties. For the avoidance of
 doubt, where the Work is a sound recording, Licensor waives the
 exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a
 performance-rights society (e.g. SoundExchange), royalties for the
 public digital performance (e.g. webcast) of the Work, subject to the
 compulsory license created by 17 USC Section 114 of the US Copyright
 Act (or the equivalent in other jurisdictions).
 .
 The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now
 known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make
 such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights
 in other media and formats. All rights not expressly granted by
 Licensor are hereby reserved.
 .
 4. Restrictions.
 .
 The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject to
 and limited by the following restrictions:
 .
 a. You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly
 digitally perform the Work only under the terms of this License, and
 You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier for,
 this License with every copy or phonorecord of the Work You
 distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally
 perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work that
 restrict the terms of this License or the ability of a recipient of
 the Work to exercise of the rights granted to that recipient under the
 terms of the License. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep
 intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of
 warranties. When You distribute, publicly display, publicly perform,
 or publicly digitally perform the Work, You may not impose any
 technological measures on the Work that restrict the ability of a
 recipient of the Work from You to exercise of the rights granted to
 that recipient under the terms of the License. This Section 4(a)
 applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collective Work, but this
 does not require the Collective Work apart from the Work itself to be
 made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a Collective
 Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent
 practicable, remove from the Collective Work any credit as required by
 Section 4(c), as requested. If You create a Derivative Work, upon
 notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove
 from the Derivative Work any credit as required by Section 4(c), as
 requested.
 .
 b. You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly
 digitally perform a Derivative Work only under: (i) the terms of this
 License; (ii) a later version of this License with the same License
 Elements as this License; (iii) either the Creative Commons (Unported)
 license or a Creative Commons jurisdiction license (either this or a
 later license version) that contains the same License Elements as this
 License (e.g. Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 (Unported)); (iv) a Creative
 Commons Compatible License. If you license the Derivative Work under
 one of the licenses mentioned in (iv), you must comply with the terms
 of that license. If you license the Derivative Work under the terms of
 any of the licenses mentioned in (i), (ii) or (iii) (the "Applicable
 License"), you must comply with the terms of the Applicable License
 generally and with the following provisions: (I) You must include a
 copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier for, the Applicable
 License with every copy or phonorecord of each Derivative Work You
 distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally
 perform; (II) You may not offer or impose any terms on the Derivative
 Works that restrict the terms of the Applicable License or the ability
 of a recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted to that
 recipient under the terms of the Applicable License; (III) You must
 keep intact all notices that refer to the Applicable License and to
 the disclaimer of warranties; and, (IV) when You distribute, publicly
 display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work, You
 may not impose any technological measures on the Derivative Work that
 restrict the ability of a recipient of the Derivative Work from You to
 exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the
 Applicable License. This Section 4(b) applies to the Derivative Work
 as incorporated in a Collective Work, but this does not require the
 Collective Work apart from the Derivative Work itself to be made
 subject to the terms of the Applicable License.
 .
 c. If You distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly
 digitally perform the Work (as defined in Section 1 above) or any
 Derivative Works (as defined in Section 1 above) or Collective Works
 (as defined in Section 1 above), You must, unless a request has been
 made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for
 the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are
 utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if
 applicable) if supplied, and/or (ii) if the Original Author and/or
 Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g. a sponsor institute,
 publishing entity, journal) for attribution ("Attribution Parties") in
 Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable
 means, the name of such party or parties; the title of the Work if
 supplied; to the extent reasonably practicable, the Uniform Resource
 Identifier, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the
 Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or
 licensing information for the Work; and, consistent with Section 3(b)
 in the case of a Derivative Work, a credit identifying the use of the
 Work in the Derivative Work (e.g., "French translation of the Work by
 Original Author," or "Screenplay based on original Work by Original
 Author"). The credit required by this Section 4(c) may be implemented
 in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a
 Derivative Work or Collective Work, at a minimum such credit will
 appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of the Derivative
 Work or Collective Work appears, then as part of these credits and in
 a manner at least as prominent as the credits for the other
 contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the
 credit required by this Section for the purpose of attribution in the
 manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under this
 License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any
 connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author,
 Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your
 use of the Work, without the separate, express prior written
 permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution
 Parties.
 .
 5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer.
 .
 UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING,
 LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT OF ANY RIGHTS
 HELD IN THE LICENSED WORK BY THE LICENSOR. THE LICENSOR MAKES NO
 REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK,
 EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT
 LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MARKETABILITY, MERCHANTIBILITY,
 FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF
 LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF
 ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW
 THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY
 TO YOU.
 .
 6. Limitation on Liability.
 .
 EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL
 LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL,
 INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT
 OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN
 ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
 .
 7. Termination.
 .
 a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
 automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this
 License. Individuals or entities who have received Derivative Works or
 Collective Works from You under this License, however, will not have
 their licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities remain
 in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8
 will survive any termination of this License.
 .
 b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here
 is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the
 Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to
 release the Work under different license terms or to stop distributing
 the Work at any time; provided, however that any such election will
 not serve to withdraw this License (or any other license that has
 been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this License),
 and this License will continue in full force and effect unless
 terminated as stated above.
 .
 8. Miscellaneous.
 .
 a. Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform the Work (as
 defined in Section 1 above) or a Collective Work (as defined in
 Section 1 above), the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to
 the Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to
 You under this License.
 .
 b. Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform a Derivative
 Work, Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original Work
 on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under
 this License.
 .
 c. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under
 applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of
 the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action
 by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to
 the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and
 enforceable.
 .
 d. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no
 breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing
 and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.
 .
 e. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties
 with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings,
 agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified
 here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that
 may appear in any communication from You. This License may not be
 modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.

 By exercising the Licensed Rights (defined below), You accept and agree to be
 bound by the terms and conditions of this Creative Commons Attribution 4.0
 International Public License ("Public License"). To the extent this Public
 License may be interpreted as a contract, You are granted the Licensed Rights in
 consideration of Your acceptance of these terms and conditions, and the Licensor
 grants You such rights in consideration of benefits the Licensor receives from
 making the Licensed Material available under these terms and conditions.
 .
 Section 1 – Definitions.
 .
     Adapted Material means material subject to Copyright and Similar Rights that
     is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material and in which the
     Licensed Material is translated, altered, arranged, transformed, or
     otherwise modified in a manner requiring permission under the Copyright and
     Similar Rights held by the Licensor. For purposes of this Public License,
     where the Licensed Material is a musical work, performance, or sound
     recording, Adapted Material is always produced where the Licensed Material
     is synched in timed relation with a moving image. Adapter's License means
     the license You apply to Your Copyright and Similar Rights in Your
     contributions to Adapted Material in accordance with the terms and
     conditions of this Public License. Copyright and Similar Rights means
     copyright and/or similar rights closely related to copyright including,
     without limitation, performance, broadcast, sound recording, and Sui Generis
     Database Rights, without regard to how the rights are labeled or
     categorized. For purposes of this Public License, the rights specified in
     Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar Rights. Effective
     Technological Measures means those measures that, in the absence of proper
     authority, may not be circumvented under laws fulfilling obligations under
     Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or
     similar international agreements. Exceptions and Limitations means fair use,
     fair dealing, and/or any other exception or limitation to Copyright and
     Similar Rights that applies to Your use of the Licensed Material. Licensed
     Material means the artistic or literary work, database, or other material to
     which the Licensor applied this Public License. Licensed Rights means the
     rights granted to You subject to the terms and conditions of this Public
     License, which are limited to all Copyright and Similar Rights that apply to
     Your use of the Licensed Material and that the Licensor has authority to
     license. Licensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights
     under this Public License. Share means to provide material to the public by
     any means or process that requires permission under the Licensed Rights,
     such as reproduction, public display, public performance, distribution,
     dissemination, communication, or importation, and to make material available
     to the public including in ways that members of the public may access the
     material from a place and at a time individually chosen by them. Sui Generis
     Database Rights means rights other than copyright resulting from Directive
     96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on
     the legal protection of databases, as amended and/or succeeded, as well as
     other essentially equivalent rights anywhere in the world. You means the
     individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights under this Public
     License. Your has a corresponding meaning.
 .
 Section 2 – Scope.
 .
     License grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License,
         the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,
         non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to exercise the
         Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to: reproduce and Share the
         Licensed Material, in whole or in part; and produce, reproduce, and
         Share Adapted Material. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of
         doubt, where Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public
         License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with its terms and
         conditions. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in
         Section 6(a). Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The
         Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in all media and
         formats whether now known or hereafter created, and to make technical
         modifications necessary to do so. The Licensor waives and/or agrees not
         to assert any right or authority to forbid You from making technical
         modifications necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including
         technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective Technological
         Measures. For purposes of this Public License, simply making
         modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)(4) never produces Adapted
         Material. Downstream recipients. Offer from the Licensor – Licensed
         Material. Every recipient of the Licensed Material automatically
         receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the Licensed Rights
         under the terms and conditions of this Public License. No downstream
         restrictions. You may not offer or impose any additional or different
         terms or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological Measures
         to, the Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the Licensed
         Rights by any recipient of the Licensed Material. No endorsement.
         Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be construed as
         permission to assert or imply that You are, or that Your use of the
         Licensed Material is, connected with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted
         official status by, the Licensor or others designated to receive
         attribution as provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).
 .
     Other rights. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not licensed
         under this Public License, nor are publicity, privacy, and/or other
         similar personality rights; however, to the extent possible, the
         Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any such rights held by the
         Licensor to the limited extent necessary to allow You to exercise the
         Licensed Rights, but not otherwise. Patent and trademark rights are not
         licensed under this Public License. To the extent possible, the Licensor
         waives any right to collect royalties from You for the exercise of the
         Licensed Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society under
         any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory licensing scheme. In
         all other cases the Licensor expressly reserves any right to collect
         such royalties.
 .
 Section 3 – License Conditions.
 .
 Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the following
 conditions.
 .
     Attribution.
 .
         If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified form), You
             must: retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor with
             the Licensed Material: identification of the creator(s) of the
             Licensed Material and any others designated to receive attribution,
             in any reasonable manner requested by the Licensor (including by
             pseudonym if designated); a copyright notice; a notice that refers
             to this Public License; a notice that refers to the disclaimer of
             warranties; a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the
             extent reasonably practicable; indicate if You modified the Licensed
             Material and retain an indication of any previous modifications; and
             indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this Public
             License, and include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, this
             Public License. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in
             any reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in
             which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be
             reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or hyperlink
             to a resource that includes the required information. If requested
             by the Licensor, You must remove any of the information required by
             Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent reasonably practicable. If You
             Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter's License You apply
             must not prevent recipients of the Adapted Material from complying
             with this Public License.
 .
 Section 4 – Sui Generis Database Rights.
 .
 Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that apply to Your
 use of the Licensed Material:
 .
     for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right to extract,
     reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of
     the database; if You include all or a substantial portion of the database
     contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights, then
     the database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights (but not its
     individual contents) is Adapted Material; and You must comply with the
     conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share all or a substantial portion of the
     contents of the database.
 .
 For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not replace Your
 obligations under this Public License where the Licensed Rights include other
 Copyright and Similar Rights.
 .
 Section 5 – Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.
 .
     Unless otherwise separately undertaken by the Licensor, to the extent
     possible, the Licensor offers the Licensed Material as-is and as-available,
     and makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the
     Licensed Material, whether express, implied, statutory, or other. This
     includes, without limitation, warranties of title, merchantability, fitness
     for a particular purpose, non-infringement, absence of latent or other
     defects, accuracy, or the presence or absence of errors, whether or not
     known or discoverable. Where disclaimers of warranties are not allowed in
     full or in part, this disclaimer may not apply to You. To the extent
     possible, in no event will the Licensor be liable to You on any legal theory
     (including, without limitation, negligence) or otherwise for any direct,
     special, indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive, exemplary, or other
     losses, costs, expenses, or damages arising out of this Public License or
     use of the Licensed Material, even if the Licensor has been advised of the
     possibility of such losses, costs, expenses, or damages. Where a limitation
     of liability is not allowed in full or in part, this limitation may not
     apply to You.
 .
     The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided above
     shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent possible, most closely
     approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all liability.
 .
 Section 6 – Term and Termination.
 .
     This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar Rights
     licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this Public License, then
     Your rights under this Public License terminate automatically.
 .
     Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under Section
         6(a), it reinstates: automatically as of the date the violation is
         cured, provided it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the
         violation; or upon express reinstatement by the Licensor. For the
         avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any right the
         Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations of this Public
         License. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the
         Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop
         distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so will
         not terminate this Public License. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive
         termination of this Public License.
 .
 Section 7 – Other Terms and Conditions.
 .
     The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different terms or
     conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed. Any arrangements,
     understandings, or agreements regarding the Licensed Material not stated
     herein are separate from and independent of the terms and conditions of this
     Public License.
 .
 Section 8 – Interpretation.
 .
     For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and shall not be
     interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose conditions on any use of
     the Licensed Material that could lawfully be made without permission under
     this Public License. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public
     License is deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the
     minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision cannot be
     reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License without affecting the
     enforceability of the remaining terms and conditions. No term or condition
     of this Public License will be waived and no failure to comply consented to
     unless expressly agreed to by the Licensor. Nothing in this Public License
